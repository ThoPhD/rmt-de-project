# RMT Data Engineering Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the RMT Data Engineering project, which includes data ingestion, transformation, and modeling workflows. The project is designed to extract data from Binance, process it, and prepare it for analysis using DBT and BigQuery.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Contains input data files and output data generated by the ingestion scripts.
- **ingestion/**: Includes Python scripts for data extraction and processing.
- **rtm_dbt_bigquery/**: Contains the DBT project for data transformation and modeling.
- **snapshots/**: Stores DBT snapshot files.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- DBT CLI
- BigQuery account and credentials

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ThoPhD/rmt-de-project.git
   cd rmt-de-project
   ```
2. Set up a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ingestion/requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Ingestion Script
1. Run the Binance rate extractor script:
   ```bash
   python ingestion/binance_rate_extractor.py
   ```

### Running DBT Models
1. Navigate to the `rtm_dbt_bigquery` folder:
   ```bash
   cd rtm_dbt_bigquery
   ```
2. Run DBT commands:
   ```bash
   dbt run
   dbt test
   ```
